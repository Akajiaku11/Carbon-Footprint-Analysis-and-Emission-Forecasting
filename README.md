## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for analyzing carbon emissions and predicting future trends. The tool uses:
- **Synthetic Data**: Simulated carbon emissions data with a linear trend and random noise.
- **ARIMA Model**: A time series model for forecasting emissions.
- **Linear Regression**: A machine learning model for predicting emissions based on historical trends.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in environmental data analysis, carbon footprint reduction, or time series forecasting.

---

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Easily generate synthetic carbon emissions data for testing and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize historical emissions trends using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Emission Forecasting**:
  - **ARIMA**: Time series forecasting for emissions.
  - **Linear Regression**: Machine learning-based forecasting.
- **Save Results**: Export historical data and forecasts to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eteh1/Carbon-Footprint-Analysis-and-Emission-Forecasting.git
   cd Carbon-Footprint-Analysis-and-Emission-Forecasting
   Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install the libraries manually:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
Run the Script:
Execute the Python script to generate synthetic data, analyze emissions, and forecast future trends:

bash
Copy
python carbon_footprint_analysis.py
Usage
Generate Synthetic Data:
The script generates synthetic carbon emissions data for 20 years (2000â€“2020) with a linear trend and random noise.

Visualize Data:
The script plots the historical emissions data using seaborn and matplotlib.

Forecast Emissions:

ARIMA: Forecasts emissions for the next 5 years using a time series model.

Linear Regression: Predicts emissions for the next 5 years using a machine learning model.

Save Results:
The script saves the historical data and forecasts to a CSV file (carbon_footprint_analysis_results.csv).
